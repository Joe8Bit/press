Joe's Engineering Lead at McKinsey Digital Labs. He writes, advises and speaks on engineering, technology, the web, entrepreneurship and building kick-ass products. He's been writing JavaScript since the late 1990's (which makes him feel really old) and has a passion for talking about it publically. He's half Swedish and half English, which means that while he loves herring, snow and flat-pack furniture; he also never performs adequatley at international football tournaments.
