Joe's Lead of UI Engineering and a Senior Architect at McKinsey & Company, specifically at McKinsey Digital Labs. He's passionate about user-interfaces, user-experiences and building kick-ass tools and products. He's been writing JavaScript since the mid 1990's, and has a passion for talking about it publically, to anyone who'll listen (and frankly, also to those who usually won't). He's half Swedish and half English, which means that while he loves herring, snow and flat-pack furniture; he also never performs adequately at international football tournaments.
