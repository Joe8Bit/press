###Personal

Joe is a 29 year old Londoner. He's half British and half Swedish, which means that while he enjoys winter skinny dipping and herring; his British side means he also enjoys moaning about the weather and he never performs adequately at international football tournaments.

He spends a lot of time reading comics and going to movies with his wife; which he then balances out with something manly like playing chess with bears. One of the things in the previous sentence may not be entirely true.
